Description: The main functionality of this package is to detect
        DNA sequence patterns that are likely to fold into an
        intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4). Unlike many other approaches,
        this package is able to detect sequences responsible for G4s
        folded from imperfect G-runs containing bulges or mismatches
        and as such is more sensitive than competing algorithms.
